## Reinfighters
Welcome to Reinfighters! This is a casual solo project with the aim of creating a simple 2D fighting game with a rock-paper-scissors action scheme, emphasis on positioning and a futuristic-industrial aesthetic. 

*NOTE: this project is currently on hold while I'm completing my mandatory military service. You could say I'm on a mandatory brainstorming period. More to come soon!*

You can try out an Alpha build of the project [https://sharemygame.com/@JDnikolo/reinfighters-test](here) or using the files in the "Sample Builds" directory. 

Further down on this page you will find (soon!) the core ideas behind the game in a short design analysis. Further down, you will see what features are being implemented in the future.

### Design Analysis
*TO-DO*

### To-Implement List
- [ ] Extra graphics and animations, music, particle & sound effects
In particular this should include:
* Foregrounds and backgrounds
* A Parried state animation

* Movement animations
* Main menu & in-game music
* Hit and weapon collision sound effects
- [ ] AI combatant logic & varied tactics
- [ ] Player VS Player mode!
- [x] Health & Round Win UI
- [x] Best-of-3 Round Structure
- [x] Menus & UI

### Other considerations
- [ ] Move knockback to its own handler
