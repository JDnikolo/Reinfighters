## Reinfighters
Welcome to Reinfighters! This is a casual solo project with the aim of creating a simple 2D fighting game with a rock-paper-scissors action scheme, emphasis on positioning and a futuristic-industrial aesthetic.

Further on this page you will find (soon!) the core ideas behind the game in a short design analysis. Further down, you will see what features are being implemented in the future.
